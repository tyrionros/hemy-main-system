# Hemy 360 - Requesting Access to Records

A comprehensive guide to requesting access to specific records in Dynamics 365 Field Service, following the "Hemy Main System". This process is for end-users from different Business Units who need to access a record owned by another Business Unit.

Parts of this process follow the "Hemy Main System" hash-tags:
#0 - Should the access be granted?
#1 - Gathering Information and Approvals
#2 - Granting Access
#3 - Verification and Notification
#4 - Invoicing
#5 - Request Complete

Below are the purpose and goal of each part for this specific process:

# #0 - Should the access be granted?
## Purpose:
- To evaluate whether the user's request for access to a specific record is valid, necessary, and compliant with company data policies.
## Goal:
- To make an informed decision on whether to proceed with the request based on the user's role, business justification, and the sensitivity of the data. This ensures that only legitimate and approved requests move forward.

# #1 - Gathering Information and Approvals
## Purpose:
- To collect all necessary details and formal approvals required to grant the access.
## Goal:
- To obtain the specific record ID, the requesting user's details, a clear business reason for access, and documented approval from the data owner or the manager of the record's Business Unit.

# #2 - Granting Access
## Purpose:
- To perform the technical action of sharing the record with the user in Dynamics 365 Field Service.
## Goal:
- To correctly configure the record's sharing settings to provide the user with the specified level of access (e.g., Read, Write, Append) as per the approval.

# #3 - Verification and Notification
## Purpose:
- To confirm that the access has been successfully granted and to inform the requesting user.
## Goal:
- To verify with the user that they can now access the record as intended and to formally notify them that their request has been fulfilled. This ensures the loop is closed with the end-user.

# #4 - Invoicing
## Purpose:
- To determine if there are any costs associated with this internal administrative process that need to be tracked or cross-charged.
## Goal:
- To answer 'Yes' or 'No' regarding the invoiceability of the task. For standard access requests, the answer is typically 'No', but this step ensures the question is formally considered.

# #5 - Request Complete
## Purpose:
- To formally close the access request process after confirming all previous steps are done.
## Goal:
- To achieve complete closure by ensuring the access is working, the user is satisfied, and any related tickets or tasks are updated and closed. This provides a clear end-point for the process.
