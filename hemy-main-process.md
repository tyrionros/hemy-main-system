# Hemy Main Process

A compehensive guide to documenting your processes in Hemy, this is called the "Hemy Main System".
In every process that you create in Dynamics365 such as Business Process Flows, it must follow the "Hemy Main System".

Parts of the "Hemy Main System" are below with its hash-tag processes:
#0 - Should it be done? - This is a decision step before going through all the processes.
#1 - Planning and Preparation - This is part of the process which involves planning and preparation of things to be done.
#2 - Execute the Task - this is the execution part of what was planned and prepared.
#3 - Finish Up/Completion - this is the usual part of the process where you have done the needed tasks.
#4 - Invoicing - since with the "Hemy Main System", everything is ideally invoiceable to clients or customers but not everything so you only choose this part in a yes or no answerable questions.
#5 - Everything is Finished - this is the part where everything in the tasks or project or process is completely done including the tasks, sub-tasks, invoicing etc.

Below are the purpose and goal of each part:

# #0 - Should it be done?
## Purpose:
- To evaluate whether the proposed task, request, or job shpould proceed by assessing its necessity, feasibility, and cost implications.
